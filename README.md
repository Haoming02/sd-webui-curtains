# SD Webui Curtains
This is an Extension for the [Automatic1111 Webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), which adds a *curtain*.

## Wut
When you don't want the passerby to see what you are generating, just add a curtain over the results that folds away when hovered~

<sup>~~Did I spend too much effort making the curtains look good?~~</sup>
